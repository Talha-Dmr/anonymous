# My Project

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the use of Git and GitHub for version control in a collaborative software development environment. The app is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and allows users to track their daily tasks with a modern and responsive user interface.

### Features:
- User authentication (sign up, login, and logout)
- CRUD operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete)
- Real-time updates with WebSocket integration
- Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop

This project serves as a learning tool for using Git and GitHub effectively in a teambased development workflow.
